# 2. Architectural Goals

*   **Component-Based:** The UI will be built as a collection of reusable, independent components.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Application logic, state management, and UI rendering will be clearly separated.
*   **Scalability:** The architecture will be flexible enough to accommodate future features and a potential backend integration.
*   **Maintainability:** The codebase will be well-organized and easy to understand, facilitating future development and debugging.
