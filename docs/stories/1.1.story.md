### Story: Project Setup

As a developer, I want to initialize a new static web project with HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS, so that I have a clean and organized foundation for building the application.

### Acceptance Criteria:

1.  A new project is created with `index.html`, a `src` folder for JavaScript and CSS, and a `package.json` file.
2.  Tailwind CSS is installed and configured for the project.
3.  A basic "Hello World" page is displayed when opening `index.html` in a browser.

### Dev Notes:

*   **Technology Stack:** [Source: architecture/3-technology-stack.md]
    *   HTML5
    *   CSS3 & Tailwind CSS
    *   JavaScript (ES6+)
    *   Vite
*   **Project Structure:** [Source: architecture/4-project-structure.md]
    *   The project should follow the structure defined in the architecture document.
    *   `index.html` at the root.
    *   `src` directory containing `main.js` and `styles/main.css`.
*   **File Locations:** [Source: architecture/4-project-structure.md]
    *   `index.html`
    *   `package.json`
    *   `vite.config.js`
    *   `tailwind.config.js`
    *   `src/main.js`
    *   `src/styles/main.css`

### Tasks / Subtasks:

1.  (AC: 1) Initialize a new project using Vite.
2.  (AC: 1) Create the initial file structure as defined in the architecture.
3.  (AC: 2) Install and configure Tailwind CSS.
4.  (AC: 3) Create a simple `index.html` that displays "Hello World".
5.  (AC: 3) Ensure the "Hello World" is visible when running the development server.

### Testing:

*   Run `npm run dev` and open the provided URL in a browser.
*   Verify that the page displays the text "Hello World".
*   Verify that there are no errors in the browser's developer console.
