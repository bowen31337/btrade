### Story: Time Interval Selector

As a user, I want to be able to select different time intervals (e.g., 1m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d) on the price chart, so that I can view price data at different resolutions.

### Acceptance Criteria:

1. A row of buttons for selecting the time interval is displayed above the chart.
2. Clicking a button updates the chart to display data for the selected interval (using mock data).
3. The currently selected time interval is visually highlighted.

### Dev Notes:

* **Time Intervals:** Support common trading intervals: 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d
* **UI Design:** Buttons should be styled consistently with the overall design
* **State Management:** Track selected interval in component state
* **Data Integration:** Each interval should have corresponding mock data
* **Visual Feedback:** Active button should have distinct styling

### Tasks / Subtasks:

1. (AC: 1) Create time interval selector component with buttons
2. (AC: 1) Position selector above the price chart
3. (AC: 2) Implement click handlers for interval selection
4. (AC: 2) Generate mock data for different time intervals
5. (AC: 2) Update chart data when interval changes
6. (AC: 3) Add active state styling for selected interval

### Testing:

* Verify all time interval buttons are displayed correctly
* Test that clicking each button updates the chart data
* Confirm active interval is visually highlighted
* Validate that chart updates smoothly when switching intervals
* Check that mock data is appropriate for each time interval
