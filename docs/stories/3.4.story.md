### Story: Order Book Display

As a user, I want to see the order book with real-time updates (simulated), so that I can gauge market depth and liquidity.

### Acceptance Criteria:

1. The order book is displayed in the right panel.
2. It shows separate lists for "Asks" (sell orders) and "Bids" (buy orders).
3. Each list displays Price, Amount, and Total.
4. The lists are updated with mock data at regular intervals to simulate real-time activity.

### Dev Notes:

* **Layout:** Two-section layout with Asks (red) on top, Bids (green) on bottom
* **Data Structure:** Price levels with corresponding amounts and cumulative totals
* **Color Coding:** Red for asks (sell orders), green for bids (buy orders)
* **Real-time Simulation:** Use intervals to update order book data
* **Sorting:** Asks sorted ascending by price, Bids sorted descending by price
* **Performance:** Efficient updates without full re-renders

### Tasks / Subtasks:

1. (AC: 1) Create order book component for right panel
2. (AC: 2) Implement separate sections for Asks and Bids
3. (AC: 2) Style Asks section with red color scheme
4. (AC: 2) Style Bids section with green color scheme
5. (AC: 3) Create table structure with Price, Amount, Total columns
6. (AC: 3) Generate mock order book data in mockDataService
7. (AC: 4) Implement periodic data updates to simulate real-time
8. (AC: 3,4) Calculate and display cumulative totals

### Testing:

* Verify order book displays in right panel
* Confirm Asks and Bids sections are visually distinct
* Test that Price, Amount, and Total columns show correct data
* Validate that Asks are sorted by price (ascending)
* Validate that Bids are sorted by price (descending)
* Check that order book updates periodically with new data
* Ensure color coding (red for asks, green for bids) is applied
* Test that cumulative totals are calculated correctly
