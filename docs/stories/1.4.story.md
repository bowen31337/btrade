### Story: Main Content Panels

As a user, I want to see the main content area with distinct panels for the asset list, price chart, order book, and market trades, so that I can access all the necessary trading information in one place.

### Acceptance Criteria:

1.  The left panel contains a placeholder for the "Asset/Trading Pair List."
2.  The center panel is divided horizontally into two sections for the "Price Chart" and "User's Order Information."
3.  The right panel is divided horizontally into two sections for the "Order Book" and "Market Trades."
4.  Each panel has a distinct border and a title indicating its purpose.

### Dev Notes:

**Technology Stack:**
- HTML5
- CSS3 & Tailwind CSS for styling
- JavaScript (ES6+) for functionality
- Vite for development and build process

**Component Architecture:**
- This story will involve creating placeholder components for each of the new panels.
- These components will be integrated into the `MainLayout.js` component.

**File Locations:**
- `src/components/MainLayout.js`
- `src/components/AssetListPanel.js` (new)
- `src/components/PriceChartPanel.js` (new)
- `src/components/UserOrdersPanel.js` (new)
