### Story: Asset/Trading Pair List

As a user, I want to see a list of available trading pairs, so that I can select a different market to view.

### Acceptance Criteria:

1. The left panel displays a table of trading pairs with columns for Pair, Price, and 24h Change.
2. The table is populated with mock data.
3. Clicking on a trading pair in the list updates the main chart and other relevant components to reflect the selected pair.

### Dev Notes:

* **Table Structure:** Three columns: Pair (e.g., BTC/USDT), Price, 24h Change
* **Data Format:** Mock data should include various cryptocurrency pairs
* **Styling:** Table should be responsive and fit within the left panel
* **Interaction:** Clicking a row should trigger pair selection
* **State Management:** Selected pair should be tracked and communicated to other components
* **Visual Feedback:** Selected pair should be highlighted in the list

### Tasks / Subtasks:

1. (AC: 1) Create table structure with Pair, Price, and 24h Change columns
2. (AC: 1) Style table to fit properly in left panel layout
3. (AC: 2) Generate mock trading pair data in mockDataService
4. (AC: 2) Populate table with mock data
5. (AC: 3) Implement click handlers for pair selection
6. (AC: 3) Update chart and other components when pair is selected
7. (AC: 3) Add visual highlighting for selected trading pair

### Testing:

* Verify trading pair table displays correctly in left panel
* Confirm all columns (Pair, Price, 24h Change) show appropriate data
* Test that clicking different pairs updates the main chart
* Validate that selected pair is visually highlighted
* Check that pair selection persists until another pair is selected
* Ensure table is responsive and scrollable if needed

## QA Results

**QA Review Date:** 2024-12-19  
**QA Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor)  
**Quality Gate Status:** ✅ **PASSED WITH CONCERNS**  
**Overall Quality Score:** 8.2/10

### Acceptance Criteria Verification
- ✅ **AC1:** Trading pair table displays correctly with Pair, Price, and 24h Change columns
- ✅ **AC2:** Table populated with mock data from mockDataService (5 trading pairs)
- ✅ **AC3:** Pair selection updates main chart and other components via event system

### Implementation Assessment
- **Code Quality:** Excellent component architecture with clean separation of concerns
- **Enhanced Features:** Search functionality, category filtering, and real-time updates exceed requirements
- **User Experience:** Intuitive interface with visual feedback and responsive design
- **Data Integration:** Proper state management and subscription-based updates

### Key Findings
- Trading pair list implemented with enhanced search and filtering capabilities
- Real-time price updates work seamlessly via subscription system
- Component exceeds requirements with additional volume display and sorting

- Visual highlighting and hover effects provide excellent user feedback

### Areas for Improvement
- **Data Consistency:** Update mockDataService to include `volume24h` field
- **Test Coverage:** Add automated tests for component functionality
- **Accessibility:** Consider adding ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Performance:** Monitor performance with larger datasets

### Recommendations
