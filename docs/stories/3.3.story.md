### Acceptance Criteria:

1. "Buy" and "Sell" buttons are present in the order form.
2. Clicking the buttons triggers a confirmation message (e.g., "Order placed successfully").
3. The order form is cleared after a successful order placement.

### Dev Notes:

* **Button Design:** Distinct styling for Buy (green) and Sell (red) buttons
* **Form Validation:** Ensure required fields are filled before allowing submission
* **Feedback:** Clear success/error messages for user feedback
* **Form Reset:** Clear all input fields after successful order
* **Mock Implementation:** Simulate order placement without real trading
* **Error Handling:** Handle validation errors gracefully

### Tasks / Subtasks:

1. (AC: 1) Create Buy button with appropriate styling (green)
2. (AC: 1) Create Sell button with appropriate styling (red)
3. (AC: 1) Position buttons prominently in the order form
4. (AC: 2) Implement click handlers for both buttons
5. (AC: 2) Add form validation before order submission
6. (AC: 2) Display success confirmation message
7. (AC: 3) Clear form fields after successful order
8. (AC: 2) Add error handling for invalid submissions

### Testing:

* Verify Buy and Sell buttons are displayed in order form
* Test that buttons have appropriate colors (Buy: green, Sell: red)
* Confirm clicking buttons with valid data shows success message
* Validate that form is cleared after successful order placement
* Test form validation prevents submission with missing required fields
* Check that error messages display for invalid submissions
* Ensure buttons are disabled during order processing (if applicable)
* Test that success message disappears after appropriate time
