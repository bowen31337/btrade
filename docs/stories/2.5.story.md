### Story: Search and Filter Trading Pairs

As a user, I want to be able to search and filter the trading pair list, so that I can quickly find the specific market I'm interested in.

### Acceptance Criteria:

1. An input field is provided above the trading pair list for searching.
2. Typing in the search field filters the list to show only matching pairs.
3. Tabs are provided to filter the list by market (e.g., BTC, ETH, USDT).

### Dev Notes:

* **Search Functionality:** Real-time filtering as user types
* **Search Scope:** Search should match pair names (e.g., "BTC" matches "BTC/USDT")
* **Market Filters:** Common base currencies: BTC, ETH, USDT, and "All"
* **UI Layout:** Search input and filter tabs above the trading pair table
* **Performance:** Efficient filtering for large lists of trading pairs
* **State Management:** Track search term and active filter

### Tasks / Subtasks:

1. (AC: 1) Create search input field above trading pair list
2. (AC: 1) Style search input to match overall design
3. (AC: 2) Implement real-time search filtering logic
4. (AC: 2) Filter trading pairs based on search input
5. (AC: 3) Create market filter tabs (All, BTC, ETH, USDT)
6. (AC: 3) Implement market-based filtering functionality
7. (AC: 2,3) Combine search and market filters
8. (AC: 2,3) Update table display based on active filters

### Testing:

* Verify search input appears above trading pair list
* Test that typing filters the list in real-time
* Confirm search matches pair names correctly
* Validate that market filter tabs work independently
* Test combination of search and market filters
* Check that clearing search shows all pairs for selected market
