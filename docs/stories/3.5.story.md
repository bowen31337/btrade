### Story: Market Trades Ticker

As a user, I want to see a live ticker of market trades, so that I can monitor the most recent transactions.

### Acceptance Criteria:

1. The market trades ticker is displayed in the right panel, below the order book.
2. It shows a list of recent trades with Price, Amount, and Time.
3. The list is updated with mock data to simulate a live feed.

### Dev Notes:

* **Layout:** Positioned below order book in right panel
* **Data Display:** Three columns: Price, Amount, Time
* **Color Coding:** Green for buy trades, red for sell trades
* **Live Updates:** Periodic updates to simulate real-time trade feed
* **Data Management:** Show most recent trades first (newest at top)
* **Scrolling:** Auto-scroll or fixed height with scrollable content
* **Time Format:** Display time in HH:MM:SS format

### Tasks / Subtasks:

1. (AC: 1) Create market trades component for right panel
2. (AC: 1) Position component below order book
3. (AC: 2) Create table structure with Price, Amount, Time columns
4. (AC: 2) Generate mock trade data in mockDataService
5. (AC: 2) Display trade data in chronological order (newest first)
6. (AC: 3) Implement periodic updates to simulate live feed
7. (AC: 2,3) Add color coding for buy/sell trades
8. (AC: 2) Format time display appropriately

### Testing:

* Verify market trades ticker appears below order book
* Confirm Price, Amount, and Time columns display correctly
* Test that trades are ordered with newest at the top
* Validate that ticker updates periodically with new trades
* Check color coding distinguishes buy trades (green) from sell trades (red)
* Ensure time format is readable and consistent
* Test that component fits properly in right panel layout
* Verify scrolling behavior if trade list exceeds available space
