### Story: Order Type Selection

As a user, I want to be able to switch between "Market" and "Limit" order types, so that I can choose the desired execution method.

### Acceptance Criteria:

1. Tabs for "Market" and "Limit" order types are displayed in the order form.
2. Selecting "Market" disables the "Price" input field.
3. Selecting "Limit" enables the "Price" input field.

### Dev Notes:

* **Tab Design:** Clear visual distinction between Market and Limit tabs
* **State Management:** Track selected order type in component state
* **Form Behavior:** Price field should be disabled/enabled based on order type
* **Market Orders:** Execute at current market price (no price input needed)
* **Limit Orders:** Execute at specified price (price input required)
* **Visual Feedback:** Active tab should be clearly highlighted

### Tasks / Subtasks:

1. (AC: 1) Create tab component for Market and Limit order types
2. (AC: 1) Style tabs to match application design
3. (AC: 1) Position tabs within the order form
4. (AC: 2) Implement Market tab selection logic
5. (AC: 2) Disable Price input when Market is selected
6. (AC: 3) Implement Limit tab selection logic
7. (AC: 3) Enable Price input when Limit is selected
8. (AC: 1,2,3) Add visual highlighting for active tab

### Testing:

* Verify Market and Limit tabs are displayed in order form
* Test that clicking Market tab disables the Price input field
* Confirm that clicking Limit tab enables the Price input field
* Validate that active tab is visually highlighted
* Check that order type selection persists until changed
* Ensure tab switching works smoothly without form data loss
* Test that Total calculation works correctly for both order types
