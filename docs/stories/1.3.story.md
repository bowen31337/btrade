## User Story

As a user, I want to see the top navigation bar with a trading pair selector and 24-hour statistics, so that I can quickly identify the current market and its performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Trading Pair Dropdown Menu
- **Given** I am on the BTrade application
- **When** I look at the top navigation bar
- **Then** I should see a dropdown menu for selecting the trading pair (e.g., "BTC/USDT")

### AC2: 24-Hour Statistics Display
- **Given** I have selected a trading pair
- **When** I view the top navigation bar
- **Then** I should see the 24-hour statistics (Change, High, Low, Volume) displayed next to the trading pair selector

### AC3: Mock Data Population
- **Given** the application is loaded
- **When** I view the navigation bar
- **Then** the statistics should be populated with mock data
