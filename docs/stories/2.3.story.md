### Story: Volume Bars

As a user, I want to see volume bars displayed below the price chart, so that I can gauge the trading activity for the selected pair.

### Acceptance Criteria:

1. Volume bars are displayed as a separate series at the bottom of the chart.
2. The color of the volume bars corresponds to the color of the candlesticks (e.g., green for up, red for down).

### Dev Notes:

* **Chart Integration:** Volume should be added as a separate series to the existing chart
* **Color Coding:** Green bars for bullish candles (close > open), red for bearish (close < open)
* **Positioning:** Volume bars should appear below the main price chart
* **Scaling:** Volume should have its own y-axis scale separate from price
* **Data Source:** Volume data should come from the same OHLCV mock data

### Tasks / Subtasks:

1. (AC: 1) Add volume series to the chart configuration
2. (AC: 1) Position volume bars at the bottom of the chart area
3. (AC: 2) Implement color logic based on candlestick direction
4. (AC: 2) Apply green/red coloring to volume bars
5. (AC: 1) Configure separate y-axis scaling for volume
6. (AC: 1) Ensure volume data syncs with price data

### Testing:

* Verify volume bars appear below the price chart
* Confirm volume bar colors match corresponding candlestick colors
* Test that volume bars scale appropriately with different data sets
* Validate that volume updates when time interval changes
* Check that volume bars don't interfere with price chart interaction
