# BTrade QA Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Quality Assurance (QA) plan for the BTrade project. The purpose of this plan is to ensure that the BTrade application meets the specified requirements and quality standards before release.

## 2. QA Objectives

-   To identify and report all major defects before each release.
-   To ensure that the application is stable, reliable, and performs as expected.
-   To verify that the application meets all functional and non-functional requirements.
-   To provide a high-quality user experience.

## 3. Scope of Testing

### In Scope

-   **Functional Testing**: Verifying that all features and functionalities of the application work as expected.
-   **UI/UX Testing**: Ensuring that the user interface is intuitive, user-friendly, and consistent with the design mockups.
-   **Cross-Browser Testing**: Testing the application on different web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to ensure compatibility.
-   **Responsive Testing**: Verifying that the application layout and functionality are consistent across different devices and screen sizes.

### Out of Scope

-   **Performance Testing**: Load testing, stress testing, and other performance-related tests are not in the scope of this plan.
-   **Security Testing**: Security-related testing, such as penetration testing, is not covered in this plan.

## 4. Testing Strategy

### 4.1. Levels of Testing

-   **Unit Testing**: Developers will be responsible for writing unit tests for their code.
-   **Integration Testing**: Testing the integration between different components of the application.
-   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: Testing the complete application workflow from start to finish.

### 4.2. Test Environments

-   **Development**: The development environment will be used by developers for coding and unit testing.
-   **Staging**: The staging environment will be a replica of the production environment and will be used for QA testing.
-   **Production**: The live environment used by end-users.

### 4.3. Test Tools and Frameworks

-   **Test Management**: Test cases will be managed using a test management tool (e.g., Jira, TestRail).
-   **Automation Framework**: Cypress will be used for E2E test automation.

## 5. Defect Management

-   **Defect Tracking**: All defects will be logged and tracked using Jira.
-   **Defect Severity**: Defects will be prioritized based on their severity (e.g., Blocker, Critical, Major, Minor).
-   **Defect Lifecycle**: The defect lifecycle will follow a standard process: New -> Assigned -> In Progress -> Fixed -> Retest -> Closed.

## 6. Roles and Responsibilities

-   **QA Lead**: Responsible for creating the QA plan, managing the QA team, and ensuring that the QA process is followed.
-   **QA Engineer**: Responsible for creating and executing test cases, reporting defects, and verifying fixes.
-   **Developer**: Responsible for fixing defects and writing unit tests.
