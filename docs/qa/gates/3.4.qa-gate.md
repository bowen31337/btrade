### 2. Acceptance Criteria Verification

| # | Acceptance Criteria | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The order book is displayed in the right panel. | ✅ **Passed** | Order book is properly positioned in the right panel with clean, professional layout and proper integration with MainLayout component. |
| 2 | It shows separate lists for "Asks" (sell orders) and "Bids" (buy orders). | ✅ **Passed** | Clear visual separation with Asks section above current price and Bids section below, each with distinct color coding (red for asks, green for bids). |
